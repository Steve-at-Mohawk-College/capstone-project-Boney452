# My Idea

#### In my capstone project, I want to create a restaurant recommendation website where users can search for the best-rated restaurants in their city. The website will display restaurant names, ratings, and links to their Google Maps locations. Users will be able to filter results by cuisines such as Italian,

#### 

#### Indian, Chinese, Korean, and Lebanese. Registered users can create profiles to rate restaurants directly on the platform. Each user can rate a restaurant only once but will have the option to update their rating anytime. This system

#### 

#### will prevent duplicate ratings and ensure data accuracy. The website will maintain its own database to store these ratings. The platform will also feature a \"Community\" section, allowing users to create or join groups to discuss dining experiences, share recommendations, and plan visits. This fosters user engagement and collaboration. By combining advanced search

#### 

#### capabilities, an accurate rating system, and a community driven approach, this project aims to provide an intuitive and reliable tool for discovering and exploring restaurants.

# Project Scope

-   ##### have a mobile first, responsive design targeting mobile and desktop

-   ##### protect against SQL injection attacks

-   ##### have authentication and authorization systems

-   ##### consistently use techniques to ensure data integrity and validation

-   ##### perform error handling and logging without exposing internal information to the user

-   ##### use relational, SQL based databases, no ORM or other framework that abstracts SQL (Hibernate, Django, etc.) allowed.

-   ##### secure data storage for player account information and any personal data input

| Who is the primary intended user of your system? What is the main     |
| reason                                                                |
|                                                                       |
| they want touse your system?                                          |
+=======================================================================+
| The primary users are **food lovers** and **diners** looking for      |
| reliable restaurant                                                   |
|                                                                       |
| recommendations in their city. They want to find the best-rated       |
| restaurants, filter by cuisine, and read real user reviews. The       |
| platform also lets users share their own ratings and engage in a      |
| community to discuss dining experiences and share recommendations.    |

| List similar web apps with URLs that you can use for inspiration when |
| building your app. Note the elements you find most similar. You may   |
| not simply reproduce an existing site; you must have a unique take on |
| it                                                                    |
+=======================================================================+
| For inspiration, we can look at platforms like **Yelp**               |
| ([[yelp.com]{.underline}](https://www.yelp.com/)) and                 |
|                                                                       |
| **TripAdvisor**                                                       |
| ([[tripadvisor.com]{.underline}](https://www.tripadvisor.com/)) for   |
| user ratings, reviews, and search filters by cuisine and location.    |
| **Zomato** ([[zomato.com]{.underline}](https://www.zomato.com/))      |
| offers restaurant listings and cuisine-specific searches, while       |
| **Google Maps**                                                       |
| ([[maps.google.com]{.underline}](https://maps.google.com/)) provides  |
| map-based search and user reviews. **OpenTable**                      |
| ([[opentable.com]{.underline}](https://www.opentable.com/)) focuses   |
| on reservations but also has reviews. Our unique take would involve   |
| adding a strong **community aspect**, allowing users to join dining   |
| groups, share experiences, and get personalized recommendations based |
| on profiles                                                           |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| What is the primary data entity in your project? (I.e. recipes, game  |

| have attributes like name, rating, cuisine type, location (with a     |
| link to Google Maps), and user-generated reviews/ratings.             |
| Additionally, users will have their own profiles, with data such as   |
| username, profile information, and their restaurant ratings. The      |
| \"community\" section will involve groups and discussions, which are  |
| also tied to users and restaurants.                                   |

1.  Testing Strategy

The testing process for the restaurant recommendation platform will be
structured, repeatable, and automated where possible. The following
testing methodologies will be applied:

-   **Unit Testing**: Ensures individual components (authentication,
    > database queries, review submission) perform as expected.

-   **Integration Testing**: Verifies that modules work together
    > correctly (frontend with API, database interactions).

-   **Functional Testing**: Confirms features function as required
    > (search, filtering, rating, reviewing, discussion forums).

-   **API Testing**: Ensures backend APIs return expected results under
    > various conditions.

-   **Security Testing**: Identifies vulnerabilities such as SQL
    Injection and XSS.

-   **Accessibility Testing**: Validates usability for a diverse range
    of users.

-   **UI Testing**: Ensures correct display and responsiveness across
    devices.

# Reflection Description

The Value of Preparing the Proposal

Before I even start building my restaurant recommendation app, I have to
write this proposal. At first, I didn't get why it was so important---it
just seemed like extra homework. But now I realize it's like drawing a
map before going on a trip. Here's why it's helpful:

1.  ###### It Makes Me Think Ahead

    a.  I have to figure out exactly what my app will do (like letting
        > people rate restaurants or chat about food).

    b.  If I don't plan now, I might forget important stuff later or
        > waste time on things I don't need.

2.  ###### The Functionality Chart is Like a Game Plan

    a.  Breaking the project into small steps (like \"Week 1: Set up
        > login\") makes it less scary.

    b.  I can see which parts connect (like I need a database before
        > people can write reviews).

3.  ###### Planning the Database Early Saves Trouble

    a.  If I design how data will be stored now (like user accounts and
        > restaurant

> info), I won't have to redo everything later.

###### The Timeline Keeps Me from Procrastinating

###### 

a.  Having deadlines for each part means I can't leave everything until
    > the last minute.

b.  The early deployment rule (by Week 8) will help me find problems
    > before they get too big.

###### Things That Might Not Be as Useful

-   **Too Many Small Details**: Spending hours planning tiny things
    (like button colors)

> might not matter since I'll probably change them later.

-   **Overly Complicated Test Plans**: Writing super long test scripts
    now might not

> help, since I'll adjust them as I build.

###### How the Course Could Be Even Better

-   **More Feedback from Classmates**: If other students could check my
    > plans (like my database design), they might spot mistakes I
    > missed.

###### A Promise to My Future Self Hey Future Me,

I know you haven't started coding yet, but here's what I want you to
remember:

1.  ###### Stick to the Plan

    a.  Follow the timeline, even when it's boring. Small steps are
        > better than last- minute panic!

2.  ###### Ask for Help When Stuck

    a.  Don't sit there confused for hours---ask the teacher or
        > classmates.

3.  ###### Test Early, Test Often

    a.  Check if things work on phones first, not just on your computer.

4.  ###### Keep Your Code Organized

    a.  Name files clearly, and don't delete old versions---you might
        > need them!

You're going to learn a lot, even when it's frustrating. Just take it
one week at a time.

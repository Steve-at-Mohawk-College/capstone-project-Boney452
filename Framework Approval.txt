# **Framework Approval Request for Flavor Quest**

**Name:** Boney Patel  
**Student ID:** 000887195  
**Course:** Software Capstone  
**Project:** Flavor Quest – Restaurant Discovery & Rating Platform

## **Framework and Technology Stack**

### **Primary Frameworks**

- **Frontend:** React.js with Vite build tool (fast HMR, optimized builds)
- **Backend:** Flask (Python) with Gunicorn (for production)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL with psycopg2 driver (no ORM, direct SQL)

### **Supporting Technologies and APIs**

- **Authentication:** argon2-cffi (password hashing), itsdangerous (token signing)
- **External Data:** Google Places API (Text Search, Details) to fetch restaurant information
- **File/Image Upload:** Cloudinary API for review images and profile pictures
- **Styling:** TailwindCSS for responsive design
- **Routing & HTTP:** React Router for navigation; Axios for API requests
- **Security:** flask-cors (CORS), Flask-Limiter (rate limiting), bleach (HTML sanitization)
- **Testing:** pytest (backend), Jest + React Testing Library (frontend), OWASP ZAP for security
- **Deployment:** Netlify (frontend), Render (backend + PostgreSQL)

## **Justification for Framework Selection**

**React + Vite:** Component-based UI allows fast development of restaurant cards, filters, and review forms. Vite ensures near-instant reloads and optimized production bundles, while React Router enables a smooth SPA experience.

**Flask:** Lightweight Python microframework, easy to customize for direct SQL queries as required by project scope (no ORM allowed). Integrates well with session management, CORS, and custom middleware.

**PostgreSQL:** Reliable relational database with strong indexing and search capabilities (e.g., pg_trgm for fuzzy search).

**Google Places API:** Provides accurate, real-time restaurant data (name, address, location, price level) to seed and refresh local database records.

**Cloudinary:** Eliminates complexity of file storage and CDN delivery; handles transformations, resizing, and caching.

**Netlify + Render:** Both provide free tiers, GitHub-based CI/CD, environment variable management, and easy rollback options.
